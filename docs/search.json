    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.2.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install the preview build of RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nThe activities and assessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. They are designed to follow the Prepare, Practice, Perform format.\n\nPrepare: Includes short videos, reading assignments, and lectures to introduce new concepts and ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities during lecture.\nPractice: Includes in-class application exercises where you will begin to the concepts and methods introduced in the prepare assignment. the activities will graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.\nPerform: Includes labs, homework, exams, and the project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to analyze real-world data.\n\n\nLectures (Prepare)\nPart of the class time will be lectures that introduce new concepts or review topics from the preparation videos. Lectures will not repeat everything in the videos, they will instead highlight important and known to be complex concepts and will be supplemented with live coding activities. You are expected to attend every lecture. Lectures will be recorded and made available to students with an excused absence upon request.\n\n\nApplication exercises (Practice)\nA majority of the in-class lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\nIn addition to AEs will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\n\n\nLabs (Perform)\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework (Perform)\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams (Perform)\nThere will be two, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.\n\n\nProject (Perform)\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nYou may discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\n\nLate work\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email the head TA before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\nClass recording requests\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at INSERT LINK. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community’s safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.  Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays."

In this assignment we explore data on college majors and earnings, specifically the data begin the FiveThirtyEight story “The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major”.\nThese data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. While this is outside the scope of this assignment, if you are curious about how raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared, see the code FiveThirtyEight authors used.\nWe should also note that there are many considerations that go into picking a major. Earnings potential and employment prospects are two of them, and they are important, but they don’t tell the whole story. Keep this in mind as you analyze the data."

A label with dashes is appropriate and suggested in place of spaces.\n\n\nWhat values does each of the following chunk options take and what do they do?\n\neval\nerror\nwarning\necho\n\n\n\nSuggested Answer\neval - Takes True or False. This controls whether a code chunk runs when rendering a document.\nerror - Takes True or False. When set to false, prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.\nwarning - Takes True or False. When set to false, prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.\necho - Takes True or False. When set to false, prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file.\n\nWhat do the chunk options fig-height and fig-width do – what do they do when they’re set in a single code chunk and what do they do when they’re set in the document YAML on top?\n\nSuggested Answer\nfig-height and fig-width change the height and width of an embedded figure in your rendered file within the code-chunk these arguments are given. When this is contained in the YAML, it changes the height and width of all figures in the document."

What does the following code chunk do?

What does the following code chunk do? Run it and analyze the result and articulate in words what arrange() does. Also comment on how it’s different from the group_by() in part (a)?\n\ndf |>\n  arrange(y)\n\nSuggested Answer\narrange orders the rows of df by the values of of y.

Run it and analyze the result and articulate in words what the pipeline does.\n\ndf |>\n  group_by(y) |>\n  summarize(mean_x = mean(x))\n\nSuggested Answer\nThe following code chunk converts it into a grouped data frame, then the mean of the values of x are calculated for each group determined by y.\nd.

Then, comment on what the message says.\n\ndf |>\n  group_by(y, z) |>\n  summarize(mean_x = mean(x))\n\nSuggested Answer\nThe following code chunk converts df into a grouped data frame by both the values of y and the values of z. Then the mean of the values of x are calculated for each group determined by the combinations of y and z. The message summarise() has grouped output by ‘y’. You can override using the .groups argument is a reminder that we have grouped data and suggestes that the dplyr package (installed when we install tidyverse) drops the last group variable before making the calculations. However, the message does not have an impact on the final result, and can be viewed as a friendly reminder that our data are grouped.\ne. What does the following code chunk do? Run it and analyze the result and articulate in words what the pipeline does. How is the output different from the one in part (d).\n\ndf |>\n  group_by(y, z) |>\n  summarize(mean_x = mean(x), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nSuggested Answers\nThis code converts our data frame into a grouped data frame by the unique combinations of y and z. Then, the mean is calculated for each unique combination. The output is now different then part d, because our resulting data frame is no longer grouped by any variables thanks to the .groups = \"drop\" argument.\nf. What do the following pipelines do? Run both and analyze their results and articulate in words what each pipeline does. How are the outputs of the two pipelines different?\n\ndf |>\n  group_by(y, z) |>\n  summarize(mean_x = mean(x))\n\ndf |>\n  group_by(y, z) |>\n  mutate(mean_x = mean(x))\n\nSuggested Answers\nThe first code chunk converts df into a grouped data frame by both the values of y and the values of z. Then the mean of the values of x are calculated for each group determined by the combinations of y\nThe second code chunk creates a new variable called mean_x and adds it as a column to the existing data frame df. Five means are calculated, one for each row of our original data frame df. The means calculated are still by the grouped unique combinations of y and z.\n\n\nRender, commit (with a descriptive and concise commit message), and push.

Additionally, the widths within sector are not to scale, making it seem that the difference between public, private, and don’t know are closer than the data would suggest.\n\nSuppose you wanted to recreate this plot, with improvements to avoid its misleading pitfalls from part (a). You would obviously need the data from the survey in order to be able to do that. How many observations would this data have? How many variables (at least) should it have, and what should those variables be?\n\nSuggested Answer\nThe total sample size is 1858 (from the caption of the plot). Additionally, we would need two variables to recreate the plot. These variables should be a services variable and sector variable.\n\nLoad the data for this survey from data/survation.csv.

You only need to submit the improved version, not a recreation of the misleading graph exactly. Does the improved visualization look different than the original? Does it send a different message at a first glance?\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 4\n# Groups:   service [4]\n   service    sector             n   prop\n   <chr>      <chr>          <int>  <dbl>\n 1 Energy     Don't know       130 0.0700\n 2 Energy     Private sector   112 0.0603\n 3 Energy     Public sector   1616 0.870 \n 4 Rail       Don't know        56 0.0301\n 5 Rail       Private sector    56 0.0301\n 6 Rail       Public sector   1746 0.940 \n 7 Royal Mail Don't know       149 0.0802\n 8 Royal Mail Private sector   130 0.0700\n 9 Royal Mail Public sector   1579 0.850 \n10 Water      Don't know        56 0.0301\n11 Water      Private sector    56 0.0301\n12 Water      Public sector   1746 0.940 \n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Answer\nYes, the improved visualization sends a much different message. Now, at first glance, it is more obvious that, regardless of service, most individuals voted that they should be handled in the public sector instead of the private or don’t know. Before, the differences within sector were less obvious due to poor scaling."

    "text": "Data visualization and summary\n\nPlot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Rmd document and successfully render it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data <- datasaurus_dozen |>\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |>, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: <-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points, hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nFor the second part of this exercise, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear (it’s dinosaurial)!\nFor illustrative purposes only, let’s calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStart with `dino_data` and calculate a summary statistic that we will call `r` as the `cor`relation between `x` and `y`.\n\n\n\ndino_data |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n\nThis is a good place to pause, render, and commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 2.”\nThen, push these changes when you’re done.\n\n\nPlot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nThis is another good place to pause, render, and commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 3.”\nThen, push these changes when you’re done.\n\n\nPlot y vs. x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nYou should pause again, render, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 4”.\nThen, push.\n\nFinally, let’s plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of faceting, given by the code below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don’t add a legend.\n\n\n\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+\n  geom_point()+\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients. We’ll go through these functions next week when we learn about data wrangling.\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |>\n  group_by(dataset) |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y)) \n\n\nInclude the faceted plot and the summary of the correlation coefficients in your lab write-up by including relevant code in R chunks (give them appropriate names). In the narrative below the code chunks, briefly comment on what you notice about the plots and the correlations between x and y values within each of them (one or two sentences is fine!).\n\nYou’re done with the data analysis exercises, but we’d like to do one more thing to customize the look of the report."

    "text": "Learning Goals\n– Use tidymodels framework to build a linear model and estimate regression parameters\n– Visualize your linear model\nIntro\nParasites can cause infectious disease – but not all animals are affected by the same parasites. Some parasites are present in a multitude of species and others are confined to a single host. It is hypothesized that closely related hosts are more likely to share the same parasites. More specifically, it is thought that closely related hosts will live in similar environments and have similar genetic makeup that coincides with optimal conditions for the same parasite to flourish.\nIn this lab we will see how much evolutionary history predicts parasite similarity.\nThe Data\nToday’s dataset comes from an Ecology Letters paper by Cooper at al. (2012) entitled “Phylogenetic host specificity and understanding parasite sharing in primates” located here. The goal of the paper was to identify the ability of evolutionary history and ecological traits to characterize parasite host specificity.\nEach row of the data contains two species, species1 and species2.\nSubsequent columns describe metrics that compare the species:\n– divergence_time: how many (millions) of years ago the two species diverged. i.e. how many million years ago they were the same species.\n– distance: geodesic distance between species geographic range centroids (in kilometers)\n– BMdiff: difference in body mass between the two species (in grams)\n– precdiff: difference in mean annual precipitation across the two species geographic ranges (mm)\n– parsim: a measure of parasite similarity (proportion of parasites shared between species, ranges from 0 to 1.)\nThe data are available in parasites.csv in the data folder.\nPackages\nWe’ll use the tidyverse package for much of the data wrangling and visualization.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\nExercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPick another member of the team write the answer to Exercise 1. All others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub. All others should not touch the document.\n\n\nTo get started, load the data and save the data frame as parasites.\nLet’s start by examining the relationship between divergence_time and parsim.\n1.(a) Based on the goals of the analysis, what is the response variable?\n\nVisualize the relationship between the two variables. Be sure to put informative axes labels and a title.\nUse the visualization to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 1 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document. Then, they should write the answer to Exercise 2. All others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub. All others should not touch the document.\n\n\n2.(a) Write the regression equation using proper notation.\n\nInterpret the slope and the intercept in the context of the data.\nRecreate the visualization from Exercise 1, this time adding a regression line to the visualization.\nWhat do you notice about the prediction (regression) line that may be strange, particularly for very large divergence times?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 2 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document. Then, they should write the answer to Exercise 3. All others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub. All others should not touch the document.\n\n\n3.(a) Using mutate, crate a new variable that transforms the variable parsim from being between 0 and 1, so that it can range between (−∞,+∞). i.e. Create a new variable transformed_parsim that is calculated as log(parsim/(1-parsim)). Add this variable to your data frame. This will be better suited for fitting a regression model (and interpreting predicted values!).\nNote: log in R represents taking the nautral log\n\nThen, visualize the relationship between divergence_time and transformed_parsim. Be sure to put informative axes labels and a title. Add a regression line to your visualization.\nWrite a 1-2 sentence description of what you observe in the visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 3 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document. Then, they should write the answer to Exercise 4. All others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub. All others should not touch the document.\n\n\n\n\nWhich variable is the strongest individual predictor of parasite similarity between species? To answer this question, begin by fitting a linear regression model to each pair of variables. Do not report the model outputs in a tidy format but save each one as dt_model, dist_model, BM_model and prec_model, respectively.\n\n– divergence_time and transformed_parsim\n– distance and transformed_parsim\n– BMdiff and transformed_parsim\n– precdiff and transformed_parsim\n\nReport the slops for each of these models. Use proper notation.\nTo answer our question of interest, would it be useful to compare the slopes in each model to choose the variable that is the strongest predictor of parasite similarity? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 4 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document. Then, they should write the answer to Exercise 5. All others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub. All others should not touch the document.\n\n\n\nNow, what if calculated \\(R^2\\) to help answer our question? To compare the explanatory power of each individual predictor, we will look at \\(R^2\\) between the models. \\(R^2\\) is a measure of how much of the variability in the response variable is explained by the model.\n\nAs you may have guessed from the name \\(R^2\\) can be calculated by squaring the correlation when we have a simple linear regression model. The correlation r takes values -1 to 1, therefore, \\(R^2\\) takes values 0 to 1. Intuitively, if r=1 or −1, then \\(R^2\\)=1, indicating the model is a perfect fit for the data. If r≈0 then \\(R^2\\)≈0, indicating the model is a very bad fit for the data.\nYou can calculate \\(R^2\\) using the glance function. For example, you can calculate \\(R^2\\) for dt_model using the code glance(dt_model)$r.squared.\n\nCalculate and report \\(R^2\\) for each model fit in the previous exercise.\nTo answer our question of interest, would it be useful to compare the \\(R^2\\) in each model to choose the variable that is the strongest predictor of parasite similarity? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 5 renders, commits, and pushes, all other team members should pull the changes and render the document. Finally, a team member different than the one responsible for typing up responses to Exercise 5 should do the last task outlined below.\n\n\nSubmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo. We will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to render and push changes.\nYou must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page by the submission deadline to be considered “on time”.\nMake sure your data are tidy!

To do this, you need to label the code chunks for those figures and tables in a special way (with fig- and tbl- suffixes, respectively) and add captions to them.\nFigures\nFor example, Figure 1 shows a positive and moderately strong relationship between fuel efficiency of cars (measured as miles/gallon) and their displacement.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mtcars-plot\n#| fig-cap: \"Fuel efficiency of cars vs. their displacement.\"\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Fuel efficiency of cars vs. their displacement.\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’re not seeing in the text above is that we didn’t type Figure 1 in the text, but instead referenced this figure with @fig-mtcars-plot:\n\nFor example, @fig-mtcars-plot shows a positive and moderately strong relationship between fuel efficiency of cars (measured as miles/gallon) and their displacement.\n\nTables\nAnd Table 1 shows the output of the linear regression for predicting fuel efficiency from displacement.\nNote that we piped the result of the tidy() function (which outputs a tibble) into the kable() function from the knitr package to turn it into a table. Quarto needs this last step to know that this code chunk produces a table that can be formatted and cross referenced as such.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-mpg-disp\n#| tbl-cap: \"Linear regression model for predicting fuel efficiency from displacement.\"\n\nlinear_reg() |>\n  fit(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars) |>\n  tidy() |>\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n\n\nTable 1: Linear regression model for predicting fuel efficiency from displacement.\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n29.5998548\n1.2297195\n24.070411\n0\n\n\ndisp\n-0.0412151\n0.0047118\n-8.747151\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, what you’re not seeing in the text above is that we didn’t type Table 1 in the text, but instead referenced this table with @tbl-mpg-disp.\n\nAnd @tbl-mpg-disp shows the output of the linear regression for predicting fuel efficiency from displacement.\n\nCitations\nYou can use Quarto’s built-in citation and bibliography features for your citations. For example …"

    "text": "Report components\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."
