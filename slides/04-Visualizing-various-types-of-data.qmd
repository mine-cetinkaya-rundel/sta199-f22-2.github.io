## How to turn AE's via Github

-- render, commit, and push

1.  If you made any changes since the last render, render again to get the final version of the AE.

2.  Check the box next to each document in the Git tab (this is called "staging" the changes). Commit the changes you made using an simple and informative message.

3.  Use the **green arrow** to push your changes to your repo on GitHub.

4.  Check your repo on GitHub and see the updated files. Once your updated files are in your repo on GitHub, you're good to go!


## **The way data are displayed matters**

What do these three plots show?

# Application exercise

## ae-03
-   Go to the course [GitHub org](https://github.com/sta199-f22-2) and find your `ae-03` (repo name will be suffixed with your GitHub name).
-   Clone the repo in your container, open the Quarto document in the repo, and follow along and complete the exercises.
-   Render, commit, and push your edits by the AE deadline -- 3 days from today.

# geom reference 

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

**A geom is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom. As we see above, you can use different geoms to plot the same data. ** - 

## Recap of AE {.smaller}

-   Pick geoms based on data types.
-   Set appropriate binwidths for histograms.
-   Turn off legends when they provide redundant information with `show.legend = FALSE`.
