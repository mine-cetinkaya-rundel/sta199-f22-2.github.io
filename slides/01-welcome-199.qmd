## What is data science?

*"Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science."*

[-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

## Examples of data science

-   Identification and prediction of disease
-   Targeted advertising
-   Supply chain optimization
-   Sports recruitment + strategist
-   The list goes on and on.....

-   **Homework:** Individual assignments combining conceptual and computational skills.

-   **Labs:** Individual or team assignments focusing on computational skills.

-   **Exams:** Two take-home exams.

-   **Final Project:** Team project presented during the final exam period.

-   **Application Exercises:** Exercises worked on during the live lecture session.

-   **Statistics Experiences:** Engage with statistics outside of the classroom and reflect on your experience.

## Lab

-   Focus on computing using R tidyverse syntax

-   Apply concepts from lecture to case study scenarios

-   Work on labs individually or in teams of 3 - 4

## Textbooks and readings

-   R for Data Science by Grolemund & Wickham (2nd ed. O'Reilly)

-   Introduction to Modern Statistics by Cetinkaya-Rundel & Hardin (1st ed. OpenIntro)

## Where to find help in the course

-   Attend Office hours to meet with a member of the teaching team

-   Email me to set up a time: esm70\@duke.edu

## Academic Resource Center {.smaller}

The Academic Resource Center (ARC) offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke.

Services include:

-- Learning Consultations

-- Peer Tutoring and Study Groups

-- ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops and more

Contact the ARC at ARC\@duke.edu or call 919-684-5917 to schedule an appointment.

## Create a GitHub account (Why?)

GitHub, Inc., is an Internet hosting service for software development and **version control**. ![](images/01-welcome-199/pnas.png){fig-align="center"}

## Create a GitHub account {.smaller}

Please do this before the *Getting to know you* survey

Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one).

Some tips from Happy Git with R.

-- Incorporate your actual name! -- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e. g., Twitter or Slack. -- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss. -- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. Shorter is better than longer. -- Avoid words with special meaning in programming (e.g. NA).

## Slack

Please click the Slack link located [here](https://join.slack.com/t/sta199-f22-2/shared_invite/zt-1esd6fig2-opHVHPgKV35RJE5gxaAl8A) or in Sakai announcements to be a part of the discussions!

## R-Studio

-- Reserve a STA198-1991 RStudio container -- Go to https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers -- Click Reserve Container for the STA198-199 container

## Our Turn

**Clone** a repo so you have access to the qmd

## For Wednesday

-- We'll start talking about the computing toolkit

-- Watch videos for Wednesday

-- Complete *Getting to Know You* Survey

Please bring laptop to class if able for next time!
