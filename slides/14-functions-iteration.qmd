## Goals 

-- What is a function? 

-- How can we write them? 

-- Why should we write them? 

-- Review webscraping 

## Warm up? 

To convert temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32 and multiply by .5556 (or 5/9). 

Write a function in R that does this. Document it accordingly.
