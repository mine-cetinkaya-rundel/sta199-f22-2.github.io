# Goals

-- 

-- Join multiple data frames 

## Joining datasets

**Data merging** is the process of combining two or more data sets into a single data set. Most often, this process is necessary when you have raw data stored in multiple files, worksheets, or data tables, that you want to analyze together.




## Goal

Join data from multiple data frames, summarize it, and create this plot.
