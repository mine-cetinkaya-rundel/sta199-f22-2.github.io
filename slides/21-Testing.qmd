## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-20`


## Announcements

-- HW 5 (Due Thursday)

-- Small typo on HW 5 (see Slack)

-- You may see some hints posted as well....

-- Drop 1 Peer Feedback 


## Goals

-- Review Bootstrapping and Confidence Intervals 

-- Hypothesis Testing 

-- P-values

-- Writing Conclusions 


## 

-- Why do we make confidence intervals? 

-- What are bootstrap techniques? 

-- How is one dot on this plot created?

## Why do we make confidence intervals? 

To estimate plausiable values of our parameter of interest

-- $\beta_1$

-- $\mu$

-- $\pi$ or *p*

## What are bootstrap techniques?

- Bootstrapping is a statistical procedure that re samples a single data set to create many simulated samples.


## How is one dot on this plot created? 

- Resample with replacement from the origional data

- Do this `n` number of times 

- Calculate a new summary statistic 

# Hypothesis Testing 

## Hypothesis Testing - What is it?

-- A hypothesis test is a statistical technique used to evaluate *competing claims* using data.

- An assumption about the population 

- A research question about the population 

## Hypotheses 

$H_o$: Null hypothesis: "There is nothing going on." Assumption about the **population**.


$H_a$: Alternative hypothesis: "There is something going on". What we are interested in.

Note: This is always at the population level!

## Try it - write it out 

As a researcher, you are interested in the number of cups of coffee Duke students drink in a day. It is reported that the the true mean number of cups of coffee Duke students drink a day is 2. You are interested in if they drink more than two. 

## Try it - write it out 

As a researcher, you are interested in the number of cups of coffee Duke students drink in a day. It is reported that the the true mean number of cups of coffee Duke students drink a day is 2. You are interested in if they drink **more than** two. 

$H_o$: $\mu$ = 2

$H_a$: $\mu$ > 2

## Mission 

Under this assumption.......$H_o$: $\mu$ = 2

How unlikely are we to observe our sample statistic?

## In Summary

-- A hypothesis test is a statistical technique used to evaluate competing claims using data.

-- We can simulate a null distribution using our original data. 

-- We use our sample statistic and direction of the alternative hypothesis to create a p-value 

-- We use a p-value to write conclusions
