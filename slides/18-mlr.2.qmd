## Announcements

-- Lab Feedback (Check it regardless of your grade)

-- HW4 Question 2 


## Goals 

-- Overfitting

-- Model with multiple predictors 


## Warm Up 

Discuss the difference between the two models below. Which model would you prefer to fit to model these data? Why?

## Overfitting 

-- Overfitting is a concept in data science, which occurs when a statistical model fits exactly against its data.

-- This doesn't make sense if are goal is to predict!



## Modeling More Than one Variable 


-- **Multiple linear regression** is used to estimate the relationship between **two or more** explanatory variables and one response variable.

-- we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more other variables

-- "account for X1 and assess the relationship between X2 and Y" - main effects 

-- "does X1's relationship with Y change based on X2" 


## Logistic Regression

-- What if the response variable is categorical?
