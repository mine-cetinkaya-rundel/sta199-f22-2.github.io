## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-18`

## Announcements

-- You have a `final-project` repo. Clone it before lab tomorrow. 

-- HW4 extended to Thursday - Check Sakai 

## Goals

-- The What, Why, and How of Logistic Regression 


## What is Logistic Regreesion 

- Modeling tool when our response is categorical 

## Terms 

-- Bernoulli Distribution 

- 2 outcomes: Success (p) or Failure (1-p)

- $y_i$ ~ Bern(p)

- What we can do is we can use our explanatory variable(s) to model p

## 2 Steps 

-- 1: Define a linear model 

-- 2: Define a link function 


## A linear model 

$\eta = \beta_oX_1 + ...$


- But we can't stop here


- Next, we need a link function that relates the linear model to the parameter of the outcome distribution i.e. transform the linear model to have an appropriate range 



## Goal 

-- Or.... takes values between negative and positive infinity and map them to probabilities


## Logit Link function 

-- A logit link function transforms the probabilities of the levels of a categorical response variable to a continuous scale that is unbounded

logit(p) = $log(\frac{p}{1-p})$ 

$logit(p_i)$ = $\beta_o +\beta_1X1_i + ....$

## What's this look like

## This isn't exactly what we need though.....

-- Recall, the goal is to take values between $-\infty and \infty$ and map them to probabilities. We need the opposite of the link function... or the *inverse*

-- How do we take the inverse of a natural log? 


## So 

-- $\eta_i = \beta_o +\beta_1X1_i + ....$

-- logit(p) = $\beta_o +\beta_1X1_i + ....$ 

- $pi = \frac{exp(\beta_o + \beta_1X_1 + ...)} {1 + exp(\beta_o + \beta_1X_1 + ...) }$

##

Example Figure: 

```{r}
sigmoid = function(x) 1 / (1 + exp(-x + 10))
plot.function(sigmoid, from = 0, to = 20, n = 101, ylab="P(y = 1)", 
              xlab = "Explanatory variable", 
              main="Example predicted probabilities based on explanatory variable", 
              lwd = 3)
box()
```


## Takeaways 

-- We can not model these data using the tools we currently have 

-- We can overcome some of the shortcoming of regression by fitting a *generalized linear regression model*

-- We can model binary data using an inverse logit function to model probabilities of success
