In this assignment we explore data on college majors and earnings, specifically the data begin the FiveThirtyEight story [\"The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major\"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).\n\nThese data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. While this is outside the scope of this assignment, if you are curious about how raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared, see [the code](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/college-majors-rscript.R) FiveThirtyEight authors used.\n\nWe should also note that there are many considerations that go into picking a major. Earnings potential and employment prospects are two of them, and they are important, but they don't tell the whole story. Keep this in mind as you analyze the data.\n\n# Getting started\n\nGo to the course GitHub organization and locate your homework repo, which should be named `hw-02-college-majors-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`. Grab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio. First, open the R Markdown document `hw-02.Rmd` and Knit it. Make sure it compiles without errors. The output will be in the file markdown `.md` file with the same name.\n\n## Workflow + formatting\n\nMake sure to\n\n-   Update author name on your document.\n-   Label all code chunks informatively and concisely.\n-   Follow the Tidyverse code style guidelines.\n-   Make at least 3 commits.\n-   Resize figures where needed, avoid tiny or huge plots.\n-   Turn in an organized, well formatted document.\n\n## Packages\n\nWe'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation, the **scales** package for better formatting of labels on visualisations, and the data lives in the **fivethirtyeight** package. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Data\n\nThe data can be found in the **fivethirtyeight** package, and it's called `college_recent_grads`.\nSince the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package. You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?college_recent_grads` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `college_recent_grads`.\nYou can also find this information [here](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/reference/college_recent_grads.html).\n\nYou can also take a quick peek at your data frame and view its dimensions with the `glimpse` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(college_recent_grads)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 173\nColumns: 21\n$ rank                        <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,…\n$ major_code                  <int> 2419, 2416, 2415, 2417, 2405, 2418, 6202, …\n$ major                       <chr> \"Petroleum Engineering\", \"Mining And Miner…\n$ major_category              <chr> \"Engineering\", \"Engineering\", \"Engineering…\n$ total                       <int> 2339, 756, 856, 1258, 32260, 2573, 3777, 1…\n$ sample_size                 <int> 36, 7, 3, 16, 289, 17, 51, 10, 1029, 631, …\n$ men                         <int> 2057, 679, 725, 1123, 21239, 2200, 2110, 8…\n$ women                       <int> 282, 77, 131, 135, 11021, 373, 1667, 960, …\n$ sharewomen                  <dbl> 0.1205643, 0.1018519, 0.1530374, 0.1073132…\n$ employed                    <int> 1976, 640, 648, 758, 25694, 1857, 2912, 15…\n$ employed_fulltime           <int> 1849, 556, 558, 1069, 23170, 2038, 2924, 1…\n$ employed_parttime           <int> 270, 170, 133, 150, 5180, 264, 296, 553, 1…\n$ employed_fulltime_yearround <int> 1207, 388, 340, 692, 16697, 1449, 2482, 82…\n$ unemployed                  <int> 37, 85, 16, 40, 1672, 400, 308, 33, 4650, …\n$ unemployment_rate           <dbl> 0.018380527, 0.117241379, 0.024096386, 0.0…\n$ p25th                       <dbl> 95000, 55000, 50000, 43000, 50000, 50000, …\n$ median                      <dbl> 110000, 75000, 73000, 70000, 65000, 65000,…\n$ p75th                       <dbl> 125000, 90000, 105000, 80000, 75000, 10200…\n$ college_jobs                <int> 1534, 350, 456, 529, 18314, 1142, 1768, 97…\n$ non_college_jobs            <int> 364, 257, 176, 102, 4440, 657, 314, 500, 1…\n$ low_wage_jobs               <int> 193, 50, 0, 0, 972, 244, 259, 220, 3253, 3…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `college_recent_grads` data frame is a trove of information.\nLet's think about some questions we might want to answer with these data:\n\n-   Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?\n-   Which major has the highest percentage of women?\n-   How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n-   Do women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?\n\nIn the next section we aim to answer these questions.\n\n# Exercises\n\n## Exercise 1: Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?\n\nIn order to answer this question, we need to do is sort the data.\nWe use the `arrange` function to do this, and sort it by the `unemployment_rate` variable.
