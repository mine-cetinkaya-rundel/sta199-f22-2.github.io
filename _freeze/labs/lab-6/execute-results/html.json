Some parasites are present in a multitude of species and others are confined to a single host. It is hypothesized that closely related hosts are more likely to share the same parasites. More specifically, it is thought that closely related hosts will live in similar environments and have similar genetic makeup that coincides with optimal conditions for the same parasite to flourish.\n\nIn this lab we will see how much evolutionary history predicts parasite similarity.\n\n## The Data\n\nToday's dataset comes from an Ecology Letters paper by Cooper at al. (2012) entitled \"Phylogenetic host specificity and understanding parasite sharing in primates\" located [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01858.x). The goal of the paper was to identify the ability of evolutionary history and ecological traits to characterize parasite host specificity.\n\nEach row of the data contains two species, species1 and species2.\n\nSubsequent columns describe metrics that compare the species:\n\n-- divergence_time: how many (millions) of years ago the two species diverged. i.e. how many million years ago they were the same species.\n\n-- distance: geodesic distance between species geographic range centroids (in kilometers)\n\n-- BMdiff: difference in body mass between the two species (in grams)\n\n-- precdiff: difference in mean annual precipitation across the two species geographic ranges (mm)\n\n-- parsim: a measure of parasite similarity (proportion of parasites shared between species, ranges from 0 to 1.)\n\nThe data are available in `parasites.csv` in the data folder.\n\n## Packages\n\nWe'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualization.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercises\n\nTo get started, load the data and save the data frame as `parasites`. \n\nLet’s start by examining the relationship between divergence_time and parsim.\n\n1.(a) Based on the goals of the analysis, what is the response variable?\n\n\n(b) Visualize the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n(c) Use the visualization to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n2.(a) Write the regression equation using proper notation. \n\n(b) Interpret the slope and the intercept in the context of the data.\n\n(c) Recreate the visualization from Exercise 1, this time adding a regression line to the visualization.\n\n(d) What do you notice about the prediction (regression) line that may be strange, particularly for very large divergence times?\n\n\n3.(a) Since parsim takes values between 0 and 1, we want to transform this variable so that it can range between (−∞,+∞). This will be better suited for fitting a regression model (and interpreting predicted values!)\n\n\n(b) Create a new variable transformed_parsim that is calculated as log(parsim/(1-parsim)). Add this variable to your data frame.\n\n(c) Then, visualize the relationship between divergence_time and transformed_parsim. Add a regression line to your visualization.\n\n(d) Write a 1-2 sentence description of what you observe in the visualization.\n\n\n4.(a) *Which variable is the strongest individual predictor of parasite similarity between species?* To answer this question, begin by fitting a linear regression model to each pair of variables. Do not report the model outputs in a tidy format but save each one as dt_model, dist_model, BM_model and prec_model, respectively.\n\n\n-- divergence_time and transformed_parsim\n\n-- distance and transformed_parsim\n\n-- BMdiff and transformed_parsim\n\n-- precdiff and transformed_parsim\n\nWould it be useful to compare the slopes in each model to choose the variable that is the strongest predictor of parasite similarity? Why or why not?\n\n\n5. To compare the explanatory power of each individual predictor, we will look at $$R^2$$ between the models. $$R^2$$ is a measure of how much of the variability in the response variable is explained by the model. \n\nAs you may have guessed from the name $$R^2$$ can be calculated by squaring the correlation. The correlation r takes values -1 to 1, therefore, $$R^2$$ takes values 0 to 1. Intuitively, if r=1 or −1, then $$R^2$$=1, indicating the model is a perfect fit for the data. If r≈0 then $$R^2$$≈0, indicating the model is a very bad fit for the data.\n\nYou can calculate  $$R^2$$ using the glance function. For example, you can calculate  $$R^2$$ for dt_model using the code `glance(dt_model)$r.squared`.\n\n\n(a) Calculate $$R^2$$ for each model fit in the previous exercise.\n\n(b) Which variable is the strongest predictor of parasite similarity? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
