Click on the repo with the prefix lab-02. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Clone the repo and start a new project in RStudio. See the [Lab 0 instructions](https://sta199-f22-2.github.io/labs/lab-0.html#clone-the-repo-start-new-rstudio-project) for details on cloning a repo and starting a new R project.\n\n# Getting started\n\n-   Go to the course GitHub organization and locate your lab repo, which should be named `lab-03-nobel-laureates-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`.\n-   Grab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio.\n-   First, open the Quarto document `lab-03.qmd` and Render it.\n-   Make sure it compiles without errors.\n\n## Warm up\n\nBefore we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.\n\n-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **render** the document.\n-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.\n-   Push your changes to GitHub.\n-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Qmd **and** pdf files. If anything is missing, commit and push again.\n\n## Packages\n\nWe'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling.\nThis package is already installed for you.\nYou can load them by running the following in your Console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nThe dataset for this assignment can be found as a CSv (comma separated values) file in the `data` folder of your repository.\nYou can read it in using the following.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnobel <- read_csv(\"data/nobel.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe variable descriptions are as follows:\n\n-   `id`: ID number\n-   `firstname`: First name of laureate\n-   `surname`: Surname\n-   `year`: Year prize won\n-   `category`: Category of prize\n-   `affiliation`: Affiliation of laureate\n-   `city`: City of laureate in prize year\n-   `country`: Country of laureate in prize year\n-   `born_date`: Birth date of laureate\n-   `died_date`: Death date of laureate\n-   `gender`: Gender of laureate\n-   `born_city`: City where laureate was born\n-   `born_country`: Country where laureate was born\n-   `born_country_code`: Code of country where laureate was born\n-   `died_city`: City where laureate died\n-   `died_country`: Country where laureate died\n-   `died_country_code`: Code of country where laureate died\n-   `overall_motivation`: Overall motivation for recognition\n-   `share`: Number of other winners award is shared with\n-   `motivation`: Motivation for recognition\n\n\n\n::: render-commit-push\n\nNow is a good time to render, commit, and push.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n\n<br>\n:::\n\n# Submission\n\nOnce you are finished with the lab, you will your final PDF document to Gradescope.\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo. We will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n\nYou must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page by the submission deadline to be considered \"on time\".\n:::\n\nTo submit your assignment:\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* $\\rightarrow$ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 199* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with exercise. All the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\"). *If you do not do this, you will be subject to lose points on the assignment.*\n-   Select the first page of your .pdf submission to be associated with the *\"Workflow & formatting\"* question.\n\n# Grading (50 pts)\n\n| Component             | Points |\n|:----------------------|:-------|\n| Ex 1                  |       |\n| Ex 2                  |       |\n| Ex 3                  |       |\n| Ex 4                  |       |\n| Ex 5                  |       |\n| Ex 6                  |       |\n| Workflow & formatting |       |\n\n::: callout-note\nThe \"Workflow & formatting\" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow. This includes having at least 3 informative commit messages, labeling the code chunks, and having readable code that does not exceed 80 characters, i.e., we can read all your code in the rendered PDF.\n:::\n\n",
