```{r}
heart_disease <- heart_disease %>%
  mutate(
    high_risk_names = if_else(high_risk == "1", "High risk", "Not high risk"),
    education_names = case_when(
      education == "1" ~ "Some high school",
      education == "2" ~ "High school or GED",
      education == "3" ~ "Some college or vocational school",
      education == "4" ~ "College"
    ),
    education_names = fct_relevel(education_names, "Some high school", "High school or GED", "Some college or vocational school", "College")
  )
