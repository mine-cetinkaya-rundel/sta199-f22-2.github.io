The first step in the process of turning information into knowledge process is to summarize and describe the raw information - the data. In this assignment we explore data on college majors and earnings, specifically the data begin the FiveThirtyEight story ["The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).

These data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. While this is outside the scope of this assignment, if you are curious about how raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared, see [the code](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/college-majors-rscript.R) FiveThirtyEight authors used.

We should also note that there are many considerations that go into picking a major. Earnings potential and employment prospects are two of them, and they are important, but they don't tell the whole story. Keep this in mind as you analyze the data.

# Getting started

Go to the course GitHub organization and locate your homework repo, which should be named `hw-02-college-majors-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`. Grab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio. First, open the R Markdown document `hw-02.Rmd` and Knit it. Make sure it compiles without errors. The output will be in the file markdown `.md` file with the same name.

## Workflow + formatting

Make sure to

-   Update author name on your document.
-   Label all code chunks informatively and concisely.
-   Follow the Tidyverse code style guidelines.
-   Make at least 3 commits.
-   Resize figures where needed, avoid tiny or huge plots.
-   Turn in an organized, well formatted document.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation, the **scales** package for better formatting of labels on visualisations, and the data lives in the **fivethirtyeight** package. 

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```


## Data

The data can be found in the **fivethirtyeight** package, and it's called `college_recent_grads`.
Since the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package. You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?college_recent_grads` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `college_recent_grads`.
You can also find this information [here](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/reference/college_recent_grads.html).

You can also take a quick peek at your data frame and view its dimensions with the `glimpse` function.

```{r}
#| label: glimpse
glimpse(college_recent_grads)
```

The `college_recent_grads` data frame is a trove of information.
Let's think about some questions we might want to answer with these data:

-   Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?
-   Which major has the highest percentage of women?
-   How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?
-   Do women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?

In the next section we aim to answer these questions.

# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?

In order to answer this question, we need to do is sort the data.
We use the `arrange` function to do this, and sort it by the `unemployment_rate` variable. Write appropriate code and report the major(s) with the lowest unemployment rate below.


```{r}
#| label: lowest-unem
college_recent_grads |>
  arrange(unemployment_rate)
```

**Suggested Answer: Mathematics and Computer Science, Military Technologies, Botany, Soil Science, and Educational Administration and Supervision have the lowest unemployment rate of 0.**

This output can look a little messy. Subset the data set to only include the columns `rank`, `major`, and `unemployment_rate`. Next, use the `percent()` function around the variable `unemployment_rate` to change decimals to a percentage. 

```{r}
#| label: percent
college_recent_grads %>%
  arrange(unemployment_rate) %>%
  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate) %>%
  mutate(unemployment_rate = percent(unemployment_rate))
```

## Exercise 2: Which major has the highest percentage of women?

To answer such a question we need to arrange the data in descending order. 

```{r}
#| label: women-percent
college_recent_grads %>%
  arrange(desc(sharewomen)) %>%
  select(rank, major, sharewomen)
```

**Suggested Answer: The major with the highest percentage of women is Early Childhood Education.**

## Exercise 3: Distribution of median incomes?

Generate a plot below to look at the distribution of all median incomes, without considering the major categories. Include appropriate labels **and** comment your code using the `#` after each line of code, explaining what each line of code does. Try binwidths of 1000 and 5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. 

```{r}
#| label: dist
college_recent_grads |> #our working data set
ggplot(                 #ggplot function to create plot
  aes(x = median)) +    #aesthetics to create plot window
  geom_histogram() +      #code to create histogram
  labs(                 #code to label plot
    x = "Median $",
    title = "Histogram of median $ across majors"
  )
```

## Exercise 4: Summary Statistics

Calculate the mean and median for median income below.

```{r}
#| label: summary
college_recent_grads %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(median), 
            med = median(median))
```

Based on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.

**Suggested Answer: Because there is some evidence that these data are right skewed and 1 potential outliar, we should summarize median income data by taking the median and not the mean.**

## Exercise 5: Median Income by Major Category 

Is there a relationship between median income and major category? Plot the distribution of `median` income using a histogram, faceted by `major_category`. Use the `binwidth` you chose in the earlier exercise. Use the plot to justify your answer.

```{r}
#| label: plot-major
college_recent_grads |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = median, fill = major_type)) + 
    geom_histogram() + 
    facet_wrap(~major_type) + 
    labs(
      x = "Median Income",
      fill = "Type of Major",
      title = "Median Income of Recent Grads by Major Type"
    )
```


::: render-commit-push
Now is a good time to render, commit, and push. Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceding. <br>
:::

## Exercise 6: Highest Earnings 

Which major category has the highest typical median income? Using your answer from 4 and fill in the partial code below to answer the question.


```{r}
#| label: typical-median
college_recent_grads |>
  group_by(major_category) |>
  summarise(___ = ___(median)) |>
  arrange(___)
```



# All STEM fields aren't the same

## Exercise 7: Variable Creation 

One of the sections of the [FiveThirtyEight story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/) is "All STEM fields aren't the same".
Let's see if this is true.

First, let's create a new vector called `stem_categories` that lists the major categories that are considered STEM fields.

```{r}
#| label: stem-cat
stem_categories <- c("Biology & Life Science",
                     "Computers & Mathematics",
                     "Engineering",
                     "Physical Sciences")
```


Then, fill in the partial code to create a new variable in our data frame indicating whether a major is STEM or not. Double check that you have successfully created this variable by selecting the variables `major_type` and `stem_categories`.

```{r}
#| label: new-var
college_recent_grads <- college_recent_grads |>
  mutate(major_type = ifelse(major_category ___ stem_categories, "stem", "not stem")) |>
  select(major_type, stem_categories)
```

## Exercise 8: Lower Incomes in STEM

Which STEM majors median earnings are less than $36,000? Please report them below.


```{r}
#| label: earning-less
college_recent_grads |>
  filter(
    major_type == "stem",
    median < 36000) |>
    select(major, major_type, median)
  )
```

**Suggested Answer: Environmental Science, Multi-Disciplinary or General Science, Physiology, Communication Technologies, Neuroscience, Atmospheric Sciences and Meterology, Miscellaneous Biology, Biology, Ecology, and Zoology have lower median incomes than 36,000.**

# Joining Data 

## Exercise 9 

We want to combine information to investigate median income of major while including information on graduate student income. Combine the `college_recent_grads` and the `college_grad_students` data sets by major code. Join them in such a way where only rows that include the same `major_code` from each data set are included. Name the new data set `college_grads_graduate`.

Then, make a new variable called `avg_median_income` by adding together the columns `median` and `grad_median` and dividing by 2.

Create a ggplot of the `total_median_income` faceted by `type_of_major`. Include appropriate labels. Describe if the relationship has changed compared to your plot in Exercise 5.

```{r}
#| label: join-plot
college_grads_graduate <- inner_join(college_recent_grads, college_grad_students)

college_grads_graduate |>
  mutate(avg_median_income = (median + grad_median) / 2) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = avg_median_income, fill = major_type)) + 
    geom_histogram() + 
    facet_wrap(~major_type) + 
    labs(
      x = "Total Median Income",
      fill = "Type of Major",
      title = "Average Median Income of Recent Grads \nand Graduate Students by Major Type"
    )
  
  
```

**Suggested Answer: Based on new graph, there is still evidence that total median income for stem majors is higher for those than non-stem. Compared to exercise 5, the histogram for stem is more symmetric, centered at a higher value (~65,000), while the shape of the distribution for non-stem majors is roughly the same, centered at a higher value (~50,000) than before.**
